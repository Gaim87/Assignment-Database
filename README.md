# Assignment-Database

These files were submitted as part of our Databases assignment. We were asked to design a database based on a given scenario, which I have not included, and submit its E/R diagram, source code and front-end (created in MS Access).

The diagram was made in [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/), the source code was written and tested using Microsoft's SQL Server (we were given short-term access to a cloud server) and, lastly, the MS Access file was also made using the cloud server's software.

Instructions of the way to connect the DB to the Access file are included in the .doc file.
